# Introduction

_**Code for San Francisco**_** is about volunteers using creative technology to solve civic and social problems together.**

**Alternate: **_**Code for San Francisco**_** is about volunteers using creative technology to solve civic and social problems together. We build products for people.**

As part of the [Code for America Brigade Network](https://brigade.codeforamerica.org/), we have created a unique environment that is truly open and inclusive. There is no application process, no minimum requirements, and everyone can choose their level of commitment.

In this way, we are as much about the people who _build_ the products as the products themselves. Every product is an opportunity to build a team, to build careers, to build leadership, and to build relationships.

Since it's founding in <mark style="color:red;">200X</mark>, Code for San Francisco has worked with thousands of volunteers, run hundreds of community events, and built dozens of successful products. Members have gone on to lead critical data initiatives in government, design and build applications in private sector tech, become ardent advocates for good government policy, and build long-standing relatinoships in the community.

This handbook outlines methods that have been tried and tested in Code for San Francisco and across the world of volunteer civic technology.&#x20;

**This is a guidebook, not a rulebook**. Use it as a starting place, and if you find better methods, share your results back with the community.
