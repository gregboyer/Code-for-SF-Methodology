# Values

Everything we do is driven by our values.

*   **Listen First**

    Empathy is at the core of our work. We know we don’t have all the answers. We listen carefully and try our best to understand and meet people where they are today. Most of the time, the solution that we think would work is different than the solution that people would use.



*   **Include Those Who’ve Been Excluded**

    We strive to reach people and communities who have been left out by leveraging our resources to create a more just and equitable world. We believe that we all do better when we all do better.



*   **Act with Intention**

    We are entrepreneurs. We don’t hesitate to go after big, complex problems—and we build together with those who have been doing this work for decades. We find our way over obstacles, and we make it work.
