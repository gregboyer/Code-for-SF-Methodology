# Values

* **Build with, not for.** Results come from partnerships with our community, including the city and non-profit organizations. Lean on their experience and networks.
* **Decide and iterate.** It's easy to get lost in discussion and decisions when building a new product. The quickest way to know if something works is to try it.
* **Give 10 take 1.** As a volunteer organization, we invest time and energy into each other. Spend more time contributing and documenting than you receiving in onboarding and training.
* **Experiment and share back**. There are no experts on how to make an open source project stick, no experts on running a non-profit organization with no paid staff. No guidebooks, no playbooks. Experiment, and share what you learn with others.
