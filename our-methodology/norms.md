# Norms



* Include others in the discussion
  * It’s easy to miss people when we’re not in the same room. Reach out and ask your colleagues for their thoughts and opinions.
  * If you notice that someone isn’t participating, call on them or send a chat message!
* Take Notes and Record Calls
  * More people will be joining asynchronously, so consider designating a note taker and/or recording calls
* Over-communicate
  * Ask more questions, drop notes on slack, create more github issues or to-dos, it’s easy to miss details when we’re not face-to-face.
* Assume the best intent
  * Communication details can get lost when we’re all remote. It’s usually safe to assume that someone might be busy, distracted, etc. rather than rude or uncommunicative

open door policy

**Principles**

_Ways of working that help us do our best together_\*\*\*\*

* **Make the implicit explicit. State assumptions, plans, questions, problems, etc. clearly and openly whenever possible.**
* **Document everything. Assume that you or other members will not always be available in person. Plan as if you knew you were leaving tomorrow.**
* **Broadcast everything. Ensure that other team members have access to all information about what you’re up to - they might need it at any time.**
* **Be inclusive. Open up opportunities for anyone else to collaborate with you. (If you’ve done the above 3 points well, it should be easy!)**
