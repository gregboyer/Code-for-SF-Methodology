# Norms

We've found the following norms help us to move forward together in our products and as a community.&#x20;

**Build with, not for.** Results come from partnerships with our community, including the city and non-profit organizations. Lean on their experience and networks.

**Open door policy.** Anyone can join any product meeting, organizing meeting, discussion or event as long as they uphold our Code of Conduct. Please be respectful.

**Give 10 take 1.** As a volunteer organization, we invest time and energy into each other. Spend more time contributing and documenting than you receiving in onboarding and training.

**Decide and iterate.** It's easy to get lost in discussion and decisions when building a new product. The quickest way to know if something works is to try it.

**Move up, move back.** If you find yourself speaking a lot, try to move back and listen more deeply instead. If you tend to listen a lot, move up and be heard.

**Plus ones.** Looking to make a decision? Ask another team member to add their plus one and move forward. Inform the rest of the team via slack for visibility. If you want to be included, just raise your hand and ask! <img src="https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/apple-medium/1f64b-200d-2642-fe0f@2x.png" alt=":man-raising-hand:" data-size="line">****

**Include others in the discussions.** It’s easy to miss people when we’re not in the same room. Consider a designated note taker or recording important calls so that colleagues who were not able to join can keep up-to-date. If you notice that someone isn’t participating, call on them or send a chat message! When possible, hold discussions in public channels rather than DMs.

**Assume the best intent.** Communication details can get lost when we’re all remote. It’s usually safe to assume that someone might be busy, distracted, etc. rather than rude or uncommunicative.

**Document, document, document.** Assume that you or other members will not always be available in person. Plan as if you needed to walk an employer or potential community partner through your work any day.







* Include others in the discussion
  * It’s easy to miss people when we’re not in the same room. Reach out and ask your colleagues for their thoughts and opinions.
  * If you notice that someone isn’t participating, call on them or send a chat message!
* Take Notes and Record Calls
  * More people will be joining asynchronously, so consider designating a note taker and/or recording calls
* Over-communicate
  * Ask more questions, drop notes on slack, create more github issues or to-dos, it’s easy to miss details when we’re not face-to-face.
* Assume the best intent
  * Communication details can get lost when we’re all remote. It’s usually safe to assume that someone might be busy, distracted, etc. rather than rude or uncommunicative

**Principles**

_Ways of working that help us do our best together_\*\*\*\*

* **Make the implicit explicit. State assumptions, plans, questions, problems, etc. clearly and openly whenever possible.**
* **Document everything. Assume that you or other members will not always be available in person. Plan as if you knew you were leaving tomorrow.**
* **Broadcast everything. Ensure that other team members have access to all information about what you’re up to - they might need it at any time.**
* **Be inclusive. Open up opportunities for anyone else to collaborate with you. (If you’ve done the above 3 points well, it should be easy!)**
*
*

```
## Best Practices:
```

```
* **Document document document.** Documentation is how you build a lasting legacy on a project, and also how you build something you can put on your resume or on LinkedIN.
* **Take Notes and Record Calls.** More people will be joining asynchronously, so consider designating a note taker and/or recording calls
* **Over-communicate.** Ask more questions, drop notes on slack, create more github issues or to-dos, it’s easy to miss details when we’re not face-to-face.
* **Assume the best intent.** Communication details can get lost when we’re all remote. It’s usually safe to assume that someone might be busy, distracted, etc. rather than rude or uncommunicative
