# Design Thinking

Guidebook, not a rulebook

* Anything can be a product. It could be an app you create, an information website, social media and marketing around a civic cause, or data science to promote better government decision making.
* Code for San Francisco follow’s a process known as “Design Thinking”, that we’ve adapted to work in an open-source volunteer environment.
* Design Thinking means that we approach problems with empathy. Instead of designing based on our our experience and intuition, we work with our users to understand challenges and opportunities from their perspective. This makes for a more impactful product that is more likely to be adopted.
* You’ll find this process across product companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Nike, Bank of America, and more. Regardless of your skillset, working through this process will enrich your skills, build your portfolio, and build products people will really love.
* We’ll follow through examples of a fictional app, “Code for San Francisco” to see how Design Thinking saves time and improves the product.
* Each step along your products development has specific deliverables that you need to provide before moving on.
* We often think we know how to solve a problem, because we know what would help us. But what happens when you and your team have invested thousands of hours into your open-source project only to find that people don’t want to use it?

Because design thinking requires us to explore ideas critically early in the process, provides some great benefits over “we’ll just build an app”:

1.  Align with users and build partnerships

    With Design Thinking, you know what your users want, because you _asked them_. You’ve observed them, walked in their shoes, and can design something they’ll use. When you launch your product, the relationships you’ve built with community partners will turn them into promoters of your final product.
2.  Make design changes early, when it’s easy

    By testing and questioning our assumptions early, we can make changes early and often. . For example, if we build an iPhone app that provides resources for the unhoused, but later find out our users don’t have iPhones, we’ll need to throw away all of our code and start over. But if we find that out early on from talking to potential users, it’ll be part of the initial design.
3.  Leverage expertise

    This is a community of doers, and we often pick the hardest problems. By including the community in the process, we’re learning from the experts. No one can tell you more about the challenges faced by the unhoused than those experiencing it, and no one can give you insight like community orgs already working on pieces of the solution.

* Design before developing
* Build with, not for the community
