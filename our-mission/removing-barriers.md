# Removing Barriers

**Any system that selects who is included, by natures, excludes others.**&#x20;

An application process designed specifically to recruit diverse talent from non-traditional backgrounds will still be limited to a pool of candidates who have the time, experience, and confidence to apply.

Code for San Francisco is the ONLY organization in the Bay Area with the following attributes:

* _No application process._ We want to know about you, but not to screen you out. No matter your skillset, there is a way to contribute in the Code for San Francisco community.&#x20;
* _Try before you buy_. Join an orientation, drop in and listen to a real product meeting, explore wht it takes to start your own product, and pitch it to see who is interested in collaborating. If nothing resonates with you, that's ok.&#x20;
* _Commit what you can_. You can make a difference in a few hours every week. Tasks may be as simple as reviewing links to ensure that they are still current and relevant, or as large as creating a new iphone app to dispatch ambulances. Based on your experience and availability, you decide what to commit to.

These tenants are core to our identity and make us a unique avenue to tech.
