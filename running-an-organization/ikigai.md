At Code for San Francisco, this translates to _**Civic Tech**_ (what the world needs and what we are good at), _**Connection**_ (what we love), and **Careers** (what we can be paid for). Our challenge is to appeal to these dimensions with a balance, and as much as possible within our community: civic tech, connection, and careers.

When designing programming, community, and methodology, consider how each of those aspects could be included.&#x20;

Here are two recipes:&#x20;

> ### When Completing Project Milestones:
>
> The Education Transparency team completed the Empathy stage of research and is defining the product that they intend to create.&#x20;
>
> **CivicTech:** They've identified a community partner that they'll be building and promoting with, and their product is an interative web page displaying the needs of schools in SFUSD.
>
> **Connection:** The brigade will have a small celebration to highlight the successful milestone.
>
> **Career:** Team members will be encouraged to take a pause and promote their success on LinkedIn by: posting about the success, the Organizing Team promoting it via the Code for America network, adding it to their resume, connecting to others on the product team, and writing recommendations for eachother.

> ### When Hosting Events:&#x20;
>
> For National Day of Civic Hacking 2019, Code for San Francisco hosted an all-day hackathon on Satuday, with the theme being affordable housing.&#x20;
>
> **CivicTech:** We opened with speakers from a local community advocacy group, TechEquity, had government officials talk about the looooong process for housing approval, and had a panel discussion. We then broke out into design sessions where these civic challenges were translated into potential product ideas.
>
> **Connection:** Attendees broke into teams for brainstorming, and shared results with the larger group.&#x20;
>
> **Career:** All participants (including speakers) were invited to join Code for San Francisco and turn their product into reality, and into tangible portfolio pieces. In the future, we would have used this as an opportunity to have folks join our LinkedIn network.
