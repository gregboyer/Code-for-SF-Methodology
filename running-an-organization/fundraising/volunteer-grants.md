# Volunteer Grants

### The Pitch

Every day thousands of people volunteer across the Code for America network, and just a small percentage of those at Code for San Francisco.

Many of those volunteers qualify for volunteer grants, where by submitting a form, their volunteer hours turns into a gift from their employer to the 501(c)3 they're volunteering with.

In short, someone at LinkedIn who volunteers at Code for San Francisco for 3 hours/week, could provide a gift of $75/week or almost $4000/year.

Across the entire Code for America network, we can easily raise $100k/year by refining this process.

Proposed metric: \$$$ raised through volunteer grants, or year over year increase in corporate donations.
