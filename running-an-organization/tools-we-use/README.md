# Tools We Use

_Code for San Francisco manages a large number of accounts for various purposes, including documentation, forms/surveys, event management, and social media accounts. This outlines those pieces of software along with some tips on what you might find._

**Airtable**

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is where you’ll find our forms, surveys and data. In particular, you’ll find the Membership Info that we rely on for outreach to specific individuals based on skills. This is the best resource for understanding our engagement and diversity.

**AWS**

[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](http://aws.amazon.com/) is one of our hosting options for apps and data science. Currently being used by the Data Science team. We have monthly quotas set up for alerts.

**Envoy**

Back when we met in person, we used [Envoy](https://envoy.com/). This is a great check-in system for in-person (free) events, and provides critical attendance information.

**Eventbrite**

[Eventbrite](http://eventbrite.com/) is how we run and paid operate events, typically in-person events. Eventbrite allows for tracking tickets, registration, checking-in attendees, and more.

**Facebook**

We have a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/codeforsanfrancisco) nonprofit organization with a lively following. Great for posting the latest news and upcoming events.

**Firebase**

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used for our link shortener. See [Using the Link Shortener](https://www.notion.so/Using-the-Link-Shortener-e46e6d27e05e414aac364ab5d3b4d5dd) for more info.

**GitHub**

All of our projects are open source, with code and tasks freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sfbrigade/). Every project that uses code, uses GitHub. It’s recommended that ALL projects use GitHub for project task boards as a standard, as this is the number one place where projects are visible to the outside world.

**Google**

We have several google accounts, but the most common one is hello@codeforsanfrancisco.org. This account is used as the default account for other online apps so we can ensure proper turnover (as people come and go, hello@codeforsanfrancisco.org stays the same). In particular, this is used for docs on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0BwojGZam3ki0RkJpd3puZUJMdUE) and domains and email accounts via [Google Admin](http://admin.google.com/).

**Heroku**

Some of our products are hosted on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), including Intentional Walk. This SAAS product allows teams to quickly standup application servers and resources.

**LastPass**

The account of accounts, [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) is where all central shared accounts are stored to ensure long-term viability of the brigade.

**LinkedIN**

We have a [LinkedIN company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18115347/admin/) and it’s very underutilized. This could be a key to our career networking at Code for San Francisco.

**MailChimp**

Mailchimp is used for distributing our newsletter and the associated analytics that come from it.

**Meetup**

[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code-for-San-Francisco/) is our central portal for all events, including opening announcements (weekly hack night), paid events, and everything in between. This accounts for a large portion of our recruitment. We use a pro account grandfathered in from Code for America. When new events are added, be sure to announce them on Meetup!

**NameCheap**

We may have some domains at Namecheap. I’m not entirely sure.

**Netlify**

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is on of our hosting / domain accounts. It’s used to dynamically generate pages based on github code, such that when github is updated a new static webpage is generated from said code. Netlify has PoliceTrends, the PANDA project, and archived version of our website, and a few domains.
