## Expectations

* We find that, to find the success youâ€™re looking for, youâ€™ll need to spend at least 3-5 hours per week on projects.
* The length of the contribution is up to you, and many members stay with us for years, but we expect project contributors to stay for at least 3 months.
* If you're not able to make that commitment, we're happy to have you at our events, and would love to have you join a project when your time allows. If you can't contribute at this time, or if circumstances change, we appreciate you communicating that. Don't ghost your teammates ðŸ™‚.
* Going on vacation? Have plans next Wednesday? Just like the professional world, set expectations, let your team know what youâ€™ll do and when. We all need time off!
