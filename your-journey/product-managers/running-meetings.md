# Running Meetings



**Weekly Standup**

Purpose: rapid status update + information sharing

* Standup happens either asynchronously over Slack or in person at Hack Night (For virtual hack nights, in person = at the team meeting).
  * Anyone who is not in person should check in on Slack in the core team channel.
* Topics of standup are: what you’ve done, what you are planning to do, and whether you need assistance from the team
* No team member’s standup should take > 2 minutes (1 minute if team size > 5).
* Brigade Captain is default note-taker for standup.

**Team meeting**

Purpose: make decisions that require input, raise proposals

* Meetings happen each week at hack night (by default, 8-8:30 pm).
* If an organizer cannot make the meeting, they should note this in Slack and during standup.
* Organizers can invite any brigade members to join, or open it up to all members. By default meetings are closed.
* Meeting structure:
  * Assign facilitator (default is captain) and note-taker/timekeeper
  * Triage
    * Any organizer can suggest a topic and time
    * Facilitator gathers the topics and team collectively sets the order
    * If expected time > meeting length, facilitator suggests either moving items to a later meeting, following up asynchronously, or extending the meeting
      * Good asynchronous options including following an existing thread on trello for longer discussions, or creating a thread in slack for votes/quicker follow-up.
  * Standing items (5 min)
    * Trello cards are quickly reviewed collectively
  * Meeting topics
    * The person who proposed a topic opens the discussion
      * Good practice: make documents available before meetings and reserve part of topic time for reading/processing
    * Facilitator helps ensure that conversation stays on track. Timekeeper should set a timer for 1 minute under the original estimated time.
    * In last minute, end in one of the following:
      * **Decide: come to a decision and assign action items**
      * **Defer: agree on a later date to discuss further**
      * **Discard: agree that team no longer needs to consider this**
